# 3DPrintingSlicingEngine

The project is done in Java and OpenGL.

The aim of this project was to create a 3D Object slicing tool for 3D Printing purpose. Given a 3D Object, the tool slices it and produces images each representing a specific slice of the object. 

A slice is produced by first finding the contour of it and then filling it with the help of Guthe algorithm.

In each on of them, we then draw the path that the nozzle of the 3D printer would follow in order to recreate the object.

You can see the results in the folder fc.PrintingApplication.SAYAMATH\results.
